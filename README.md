Cindy L. Says‚Äì

![Magoosh review](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b3f06e0-9239-4b1d-abf8-eb60a1491069)

I‚Äôve always loved teaching and wanted to work in international education policy, but my initial GRE scores‚Äîespecially math‚Äîwere too low. I‚Äôm not a numbers person, so I needed something flexible and practice-heavy. Magoosh was perfect: affordable, self-paced, and packed with questions. The team was super helpful, too‚Äîwhen my plan was about to expire right before my test, they extended it without hesitation. My scores ended up way above average, and now I‚Äôm teaching in Hong Kong while applying to grad schools. Magoosh truly made it possible!

Their clear videos, smart analytics, and targeted practice made it easy to focus on what I needed. Huge thanks to Magoosh‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt have done it without you!
